# Modular C/C++ Application Framework
Modular is an open-source, cross-platform, MIT licensed modular framework for C/C++ applications. It was inspired by the organization of the the Tianocore project. Instead of firmware, however, Modular aims to be a framework for developing user-mode applications.

What Modular provides:

* Ability to run on any major OS
* Ability to be extended trivially
* Ability to be deployed for personal and commercial purposes*
* Allows free and non-free code to coexist without license conflicts
* Strict adherence to modern C++ philosophy where possible

*The core of Modular is MIT licensed, but third-party package providers have the right to license their code however they wish.
